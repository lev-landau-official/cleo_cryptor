# cleo_cryptor

Forget about n00bs stealing your CLEO scripts, use this tool to encrypt your files.

Other CLEO encryptors are broken and useless; use this tool to break popular encryption algorithms.

## Features

- **Secure encryption algorithm**. You have stumbled across the best (hands down) CLEO encryptor. Algorithm so strong it does not break.

- **Custom message**. Add your text (up to 6kB), multi-line message supported.

- **Protection against tampering**. What's worse than stolen source code? Correct, it's stolen authorship. Not gonna happen though, modified files refuse to work.

- **Password protection**. You heard it right! It is optional, but you can protect your CLEO scripts with a password. This means you can retrieve source code of your script using your secret phrase. When script encrypted without a password, source code is not retrievable.

- **General file encryptor**. Okay, I will say this... you can use this tool to encrypt files other than CLEO scripts, in which case password is mandatory. Although keep in mind, this tool does not necessarily comply with "safety standards of cryptography". Huge files supported.

- **Decryption**. Every other CLEO encryptor is broken and useless, trust me on this. This functionality allows you to break popular encryption algorithms (MogAika, FYP, SlonoBoyko etc.). Some scripts may not decrypt, show them to me! Will decrypt on the next release.

- **Deobfuscation**. Simply because decryption is not enough; some scripts have intentionally scrambled source code and require a little clean-up.

## Usage

- Place `decryptor.cleo` in CLEO folder. This file is mandatory when running encrypted scripts; otherwise expect a crash.  
- Open `cleo_encryptor.bat` and `cleo_decryptor.bat` files in *edit* mode for further usage information.
